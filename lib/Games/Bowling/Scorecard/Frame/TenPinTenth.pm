=head1 NAME

Games::Bowling::Scorecard::Frame::TenPinTenth - ten pin's weird 10th frame

=head1 VERSION

version 0.104

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The tenth frame of ten pin bowling is weird.  If you bowl a strike or spare,
you're allowed to throw balls to complete the frame's scoring.  The extra balls
are only counted for bonus points.  In other words, if the first two balls in
the tenth frame are strikes, the second ball is not counted as a "pending"
strike.  If this is confusing, don't worry!  That's why you're using this
module.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 is_done

The tenth frame is done if: (a) three balls have been bowled or (b) two balls
have been bowled, totalling less than ten.

=head2 is_pending

The tenth frame is never pending.  Once it's done, its score is final.

=head2 roll_ok

The tenth frame's C<roll_ok> is identical to the standard C<roll_ok>, but
replaces the "can't total more than 10" rule with a more complex rule.
